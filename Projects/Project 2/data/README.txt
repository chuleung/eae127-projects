WakeVelocityDistribution.dat

Contains x-component velocity profiles in the z direction before the airfoil and in the wake of the airfoil.
Columns are:  z, u0, u1,
z --> position in the direction normal to the chord of the airfoil,
u0 --> x-velocity distribution in the z-direction just before the leading edge of the airfoil,
u1 --> x-velocity distribution in the z-direction just after the trailing edge of the airfoil.
